IMGT/HighV-QUEST

IMGT/HighV-QUEST[1] (V-QUERy and STandardization) is part of IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® http://www.imgt.org [2].

IMGT/HighV-QUEST is the high-throughput version of IMGT/V-QUEST [3,4] for the analysis of thousands of immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) rearranged nucleotide sequences (up to 150 000 sequences) per run.

IMGT/HighV-QUEST has been developed by IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics Information System® to answer the problematic of the analysis of the antigen receptor data from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).

Note that:

    All IMGT/HighV-QUEST users should be registered in order to be able to use this platform.
    IMGT/HighV-QUEST works with rearranged V-J and V-D-J sequences and germline V-GENEs, but does not work with germline D-GENEs or J-GENEs.
    IMGT/HighV-QUEST can optionally analyse sequences with DNA insertions or deletions (which do not respect the IMGT unique numbering).
    Sequences containing two V domains (as scFv) need to be split (at the level of the linker) prior to IMGT/HighV-QUEST analysis.
    IMGT/HighV-QUEST does not work with out-of-frame pseudogenes as they cannot be numbered according to the amino acid IMGT unique numbering. You may use BLAST in order to compare your sequence with F+ORF+all P genes and alleles IMGT reference sequences (select for "Database" : "IMGT/GENE-DB reference sequences").
    IMGT/HighV-QUEST does not work, or will give aberrant results, for too short partial sequences, sequences containing a cluster of V-GENEs, or sequences with too long 5'UTR or 3'UTR. For these sequences, you may use BLAST in order to identify homologous sequences against IMGT/LIGM-DB (select for "Database" : "IMGT/LIGM-DB") .

Once registered and the submission is accepted by IMGT/HighV-QUEST administrator, users can log in into IMGT/HighV-QUEST using their e-mail and the password they selected during the registration. The first page that a user may see after logging in is the Search Page of IMGT/HighV-QUEST.

IMGT clonotype definition and characterization. In the litera-
ture, clonotypes are defined differently, depending on the
experiment design (functional specificity) or available data. Thus,
a clonotype may denote either a complete receptor (e.g., TR
alpha - beta), or only one of the two chains of the receptor (e.g.,
TRA or TRB), or one domain (e.g., V-BETA), or the CDR3
sequence of a domain. Moreover the sequence can be at the
amino acid (AA) or nucleotide level, and this is rarely specified.
Therefore, our priority was to define clonotypes and their prop-
erties, which could be identified and characterized by IMGT/
HighV-QUEST, unambiguously.
In IMGT, the clonotype, designated as ‘IMGT clonotype (AA)’,
is defined by a unique V-(D)-J rearrangement (with IMGT gene
and allele names determined by IMGT/HighV-QUEST at the
nucleotide level 21–25 ) and a unique CDR3-IMGT AA (in-frame)
junction sequence 39–41 . To identify ‘IMGT clonotypes (AA)’ in a
given IMGT/HighV-QUEST data set, the ‘1 copy’ are filtered to
select for sequences with in-frame junction, conserved anchors
104 and 118 ‘C, F’ (‘C’ is 2nd-CYS 104, and ‘F’ is the J-PHE 118 of
V-BETA) 36–38 and for V and J functional or ORF, and ‘single
allele’ (for V and J; Supplementary Fig. S1).
